## **EXPLANATION OF THE CODE**

1. At first I have created the components folder inside the src folder . Inside the components folder I have created two files ( i.e CustomUseCase.js,          
   CustomUseCase.module.css).

2. Here inside the CustomUseCase.js I have written the code for creating the web-based application for touch typing , Touch typing is typing without looking at the   
   keyboard. The fundamental idea is that each finger is given its own section of the keyboard and your fingers learn the location of the keyboard through practising
   regularly and gaining muscle memory to eventually build up speed whilst typing. While touch typing is a practice of keys, words & sentences. For this exercise, I have      focus only on keys practice & only on the 8 keys of the keyboard (asdfjkl;).

3. Inside the CustomUseCase.module.css I have written the css for CustomUseCase.js file.
